        alt="This is an block of chain in blockchain">

    <p>A blockchain is a type of Digital Ledger Technology (DLT) that consists of growing list of records, called
        blocks, that are securely linked together using cryptography.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block contains a
        cryptographic
        hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where
        data nodes are represented by leafs). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was
        created. Since each block contains information about the block previous to it, they effectively form a chain
        (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently,
        blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be
        altered retroactively without altering all subsequent <br><br>

        Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed
        ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction
        blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be
        considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault
        tolerance.<sup>[5]</sup> <br><br>

        The blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in
        2008<sup>[6]</sup> to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on
        previous
        work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.<sup>[7]</sup> The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains
        unknown to
        date. The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the
        double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has
        inspired other applications<sup>[3][2]</sup> and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used
        by
        cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.<sup>[8]</sup> <br><br>

        Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized
        blockchains without a proper security model "snake oil";<sup>[9]</sup> however, others have argued that
        permissioned
        blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than
        permissionless ones.<sup>[4][10]</sup></p><br>

        alt="Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin transactions per day (January 2011 – January 2021) graph">
    <p>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems
        Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."<sup>[11]</sup> Further work on a
        cryptographically
        secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.<sup>[4][12]</sup> They
        wanted to
        implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave
        Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document
        certificates to be collected into one block.[4][13] Under their company Surety, their document certificate
        hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.<sup>[14]</sup> <br><br>

        The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto
        in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks
        without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the
        rate at which blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a
        core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the
        network.<sup>[3]</sup><br><br>

        In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on
        the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).<sup>[15]</sup> In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and
        from
        January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had
        exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.<sup>[16]</sup><br><br>

        The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually
        popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.<sup>[17]</sup><br><br>

        According to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that blockchains attained
        a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters'
        phase.<sup>[18]</sup>
        Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of
        Digital Commerce.

        In May 2018, Gartner found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their
        organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term "planning or [looking at] active experimentation with
        blockchain".<sup>[19]</sup> For the year 2019 Gartner reported 5% of CIOs believed blockchain technology was a
        'game-changer' for their business.[20] <br><br></p>

    <h2>Structure & Design</h2>

        alt="Blockchain formation. The main chain (black) consists of the longest series of blocks from the genesis block (green) to the current block. Orphan blocks (purple) exist outside of the main chain.">
    <p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called
        blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered
        retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.<sup>[3][21]</sup> This allows the participants
        to verify
        and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.<sup>[22]</sup> A blockchain database is
        managed
        autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass
        collaboration powered by collective self-interests.<sup>[23]</sup> Such a design facilitates robust workflow
        where
        participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the
        characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was
        transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has been described as
        a value-exchange protocol.<sup>[24]</sup> A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up
        to detail
        the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.<sup>[citation needed]</sup><br>
        Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:<sup>[25]</sup>
    <ul>
        <li>infrastructure (hardware)</li>
        <li>networking (node discovery, information propagation<sup>[26]</sup> and verification)</li>
        <li>consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)</li>
        <li>data (blocks, transactions)</li>
        <li>application (smart contracts/decentralized applications, if applicable)</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h3>Block</h3>

    <p>Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.<sup>[3]</sup> Each
        block includes
        the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a
        chain.<sup>[3]</sup>
        This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the initial block,
        which is known as the genesis block (Block 0).<sup>[27][28]</sup> To assure the integrity of a block and the
        data contained
        in it, the block is usually digitally signed.<sup>[29]</sup> <br><br>

        Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure
        hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so
        that one with a higher score can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are
        called orphan blocks.<sup>[28]</sup> Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from
        time to
        time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a
        higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their
        own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any
        particular entry will remain in the best version of history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the
        score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old
        blocks. Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially<sup>[30]</sup> as
        more blocks
        are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.<sup>[3][31]</sup>: ch. 08 <Sup>[32]</Sup> For example,
        bitcoin uses a
        proof-of-work system, where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the
        network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of computation. Within
        a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and parallel
        manner.<sup>[33]</sup></p><br>

    <h4>Bloock time</h4>

    <p>The block tfime is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain. Some
        blockchains
        create a new block as frequently as every five seconds.<sup>[34]</sup> By the time of block completion, the
        included data becomes
        verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time
        means faster transactions.
        The block time for Ethereum is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10
        minutes.<sup>[35]</sup></p><br>

    <h4>Hard forks</h4>

    <p><i>This section is an excerpt from Fork (blockchain) § Hard fork.[edit]</i><br>
        A hard fork is a rule change such that the software validating according to the old rules will see the blocks
        produced according to the new rules as invalid. In case of a hard fork, all nodes meant to work in accordance
        with the new rules need to upgrade their software. If one group of nodes continues to use the old software while
        the other nodes use the new software, a permanent split can occur.

        For example, Ethereum was hard-forked in 2016 to "make whole" the investors in The DAO, which had been hacked by
        exploiting a vulnerability in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split creating Ethereum and
        Ethereum Classic chains. In 2014 the Nxt community was asked to consider a hard fork that would have led to a
        rollback of the blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT from a major
        cryptocurrency exchange. The hard fork proposal was rejected, and some of the funds were recovered after
        negotiations and ransom payment. Alternatively, to prevent a permanent split, a majority of nodes using the new
        software may return to the old rules, as was the case of bitcoin split on 12 March 2013.<sup>[36]</sup>

        A more recent hard-fork example is of Bitcoin in 2017, which resulted in a split creating Bitcoin
        Cash.<sup>[37]</sup> The network split was mainly due to a disagreement in how to increase the transactions per
        second to accommodate for demand.<sup>[38]</sup></p><br><br>

    <h3>Decentralization</h3>

    <p>By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates a number of risks that come with data
        being held centrally.[3] The decentralized blockchain may use ad hoc message passing and distributed networking.
        One risk of a lack of decentralization is a so-called "51% attack" where a central entity can gain control of
        more than half of a network and can manipulate that specific blockchain record at will, allowing
        double-spending.<sup>[39]</sup>

        Peer-to-peer blockchain networks lack centralized points of vulnerability that computer crackers can exploit;
        likewise, they have no central point of failure. Blockchain security methods include the use of public-key
        cryptography.[40]: 5  A public key (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain.
        Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A private key is like a password
        that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various
        capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered
        incorruptible.<sup>[3]</sup>

        Every node in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain. Data quality is maintained by massive
        database replication<sup>[41] </sup>and computational trust. No centralized "official" copy exists and no user
        is "trusted" more than any other.<sup>[40]</sup> Transactions are broadcast to the network using the software.
        Messages are delivered on a best-effort basis. Early blockchains rely on energy-intensive mining nodes to
        validate transactions,<sup>[28]</sup> add them to the block they are building, and then broadcast the completed
        block to other nodes.[31]: ch. 08  Blockchains use various time-stamping schemes, such as proof-of-work, to
        serialize changes.[42] Later consensus methods include proof of stake.[28] The growth of a decentralized
        blockchain is accompanied by the risk of centralization because the computer resources required to process
        larger amounts of data become more expensive.<sup>[43]</sup></p>

    <h3>Openness</h3>

    <p>Open blockchains are more user-friendly than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public,
        still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen
        over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers
        tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a
        blockchain.<sup>[44][45][46][47][48]</sup> Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term
        "blockchain" may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains
        serve as a distributed version of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) in databases.<sup>[49]</sup> Just as
        MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent
        two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.<sup>[50]</sup>: 30–31  Opponents say that
        permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification,
        and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision.<sup>[44][46]</sup> Nikolai
        Hampton of Computerworld said that "many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome
        databases," and "without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with
        suspicion."<sup>[9][51]</sup></p>


    <h4>Permissionless (public) blockchain</h4>

    <p>An advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not
        required and no access control is needed.[30] This means that applications can be added to the network without
        the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a transport layer.<sup>[30]</sup>

        Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include proof
        of work. To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses Hashcash puzzles. While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by Adam
        Back, the original idea was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992
        paper "Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail".

        In 2016, venture capital investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in
        China.<sup>[52]</sup> Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains. As of April 2018,
        bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.</p>

    <h4>Permissioned (private) blockchain</h4>

    <p> <i>See also: Distributed ledger</i>
        Permissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network.<sup>[53]</sup> In
        contrast to public blockchain networks, validators on private blockchain networks are vetted by the network
        owner. They do not rely on anonymous nodes to validate transactions nor do they benefit from the network
        effect.<sup>[54]</sup> Permissioned blockchains can also go by the name of 'consortium' blockchains.<sup>[55]
        </sup>It has been argued that permissioned blockchains can guarantee a certain level of decentralization, if
        carefully designed, as opposed to permissionless blockchains, which are often centralized in
        practice.<sup>[10]</sup></p>

    <h4>Disadvantages of permissioned blockchain</h4>

    <p>Nikolai Hampton pointed out in Computerworld that "There is also no need for a '51 percent' attack on a private
        blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block creation
        resources. If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could
        effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished."<sup>[9]</sup> This
        has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a financial crisis or debt crisis like the
        financial crisis of 2007–08, where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the
        expense of others,[56] and "the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort. It's
        unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using gigawatts of computing power — it's
        time-consuming and expensive."<sup>[9]</sup> He also said, "Within a private blockchain there is also no 'race';
        there's no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors. This means that many in-house
        blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases."<Sup>[9]</Sup></p>
    <h4>Blockchain analysis</h4>

    <p>The analysis of public blockchains has become increasingly important with the popularity of bitcoin, Ethereum,
        litecoin and other cryptocurrencies.<sup>[57]</sup> A blockchain, if it is public, provides anyone who wants
        access to observe and analyse the chain data, given one has the know-how. The process of understanding and
        accessing the flow of crypto has been an issue for many cryptocurrencies, crypto exchanges and
        banks.<sup>[58][59]</sup> The reason for this is accusations of blockchain-enabled cryptocurrencies enabling
        illicit dark market trade of drugs, weapons, money laundering, etc.<sup>[60]</sup> A common belief has been that
        cryptocurrency is private and untraceable, thus leading many actors to use it for illegal purposes. This is
        changing and now specialised tech companies provide blockchain tracking services, making crypto exchanges,
        law-enforcement and banks more aware of what is happening with crypto funds and fiat-crypto exchanges. The
        development, some argue, has led criminals to prioritise the use of new cryptos such as
        Monero.<sup>[61][62][63]</sup> The question is about the public accessibility of blockchain data and the
        personal privacy of the very same data. It is a key debate in cryptocurrency and ultimately in the
        blockchain.<sup>[64]</sup></p>
    <h3>Standardisation</h3>

    <p>In April 2016, Standards Australia submitted a proposal to the International Organization for Standardization to
        consider developing standards to support blockchain technology. This proposal resulted in the creation of ISO
        Technical Committee 307, Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies.<sup>[65]</sup> The technical committee
        has working groups relating to blockchain terminology, reference architecture, security and privacy, identity,
        smart contracts, governance and interoperability for blockchain and DLT, as well as standards specific to
        industry sectors and generic government requirements.<sup>[66]</sup>[non-primary source needed] More than 50
        countries are participating in the standardization process together with external liaisons such as the Society
        for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the European Commission, the International
        Federation of Surveyors, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the United Nations Economic
        Commission for Europe (UNECE).<sup>[66]</sup>

        Many other national standards bodies and open standards bodies are also working on blockchain standards.[67]
        These include the National Institute of Standards and Technology<sup></sup> (NIST), the European Committee for
        Electrotechnical Standardization<sup>[69]</sup> (CENELEC), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
        Engineers<sup>[70]</sup> (IEEE), the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards
        (OASIS), and some individual participants in the Internet Engineering Task Force<sup>[71]</sup> (IETF).</p>
    <h3>Centralized Blockchain</h3>

    <p>Although most of blockchain implementation are decentralized and distributed, Oracle launched a centralized
        blockchain table feature in Oracle 21c database. The Blockchain Table in Oracle 21c database is a centralized
        blockchain which provide immutable feature. Compared to decentralized blockchains, centralized blockchains
        normally can provide a higher throughput and lower latency of transactions than consensus-based distributed
        blockchains.<sup.[72][73]</p>

            <h2>Types</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Public blockchains</h3>

            <p>A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an Internet connection can send
                transactions to it as well as become a validator (i.e., participate in the execution of a consensus
                protocol).<Sup>[74]</Sup>[self-published source?] Usually, such networks offer economic incentives for
                those who secure them and utilize some type of a Proof of Stake or Proof of Work algorithm.

                Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are the bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum
                blockchain.</p>
            <h3>Private blockchains</h3>

            <p>A private blockchain is permissioned.<sup>[53]</sup> One cannot join it unless invited by the network
                administrators. Participant and validator access is restricted. To distinguish between open blockchains
                and other peer-to-peer decentralized database applications that are not open ad-hoc compute clusters,
                the terminology Distributed Ledger (DLT) is normally used for private blockchains.</p>

            <h3>Hybrid blockchains</h3>

            <p>A hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and decentralized features.<sup>[75]</sup> The exact
                workings of the chain can vary based on which portions of centralization and decentralization are used.
            </p>
            <h3>Sidechains</h3>
            <p>A sidechain is a designation for a blockchain ledger that runs in parallel to a primary
                blockchain.<sup>[76][77]</sup> Entries from the primary blockchain (where said entries typically
                represent digital assets) can be linked to and from the sidechain; this allows the sidechain to
                otherwise operate independently of the primary blockchain (e.g., by using an alternate means of record
                keeping, alternate consensus algorithm, etc.).<Sup>[78][better source needed]</Sup></p>
